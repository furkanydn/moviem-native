This project [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) apis. It was created to learn the sections on the home page and functions such as search. In this application, I write an example of how everything looks and works.

## [Requirements](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
You can run React Native apps on devices supported by the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
React Native requires Java SE Development Kit (JDK) [OpenJDK](openjdk.java.net), [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the [SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) in particular.

## Getting Started
Required to perform the steps in [React Native Introduction](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) before you can start the application.

`$ cd $PROJECT_PATH` into this project directory.

`$ pod install` in `$IOS_PATH` directory

`$ npm install` or `$ yarn install` project with the commands.

Run the project `$ npx react-native run-android` or `$ npx react-native run-ios` with the commands.
